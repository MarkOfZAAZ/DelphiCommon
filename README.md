# Delphi Dabbling
The code in this repository are a collection of bits n bobs that I am fed up of re-creating in every application!

## uHelperListView
This is essentially the Component TListViewZaaz (modified TListView) as Class Helpers, hence no requirement to install a component! (Makes moving the code to a different IDE simpler)

## Launch a second form

### FMX (Android to avoid thread issues)
procedure TMainForm.btnShowSecondForm(Sender: TObject);
var
   frm: TTheSecondForm;
begin
   frm := TTheSecondForm.Create(nil);
   frm.ShowModal (
      procedure(ModalResult: TModalResult)
      begin
         // Put something here to do AFTER form has closed and come back e.g.
         // RefreshFirstPage;
      end
   );
end;
### FMX with error catching
procedure TMainForm.btnShowSecondForm(Sender: TObject);
var
   frm: TTheSecondForm;
begin
   try
      frm := TTheSecondForm.Create(nil);
      frm.ShowModal(
      procedure(ModalResult: TModalResult)
      begin
         try
            // Put something here to do AFTER form has closed and come back e.g.
            // RefreshFirstPage;
         except
            on E: Exception do
               ShowMessage('Error after closing form: ' + E.Message);
         end;
         frm.DisposeOf; // Ensures proper cleanup on mobile
      end
      );
   except
      on E: Exception do
         ShowMessage('Error showing form: ' + E.Message);
   end;
end;

### VCL
procedure TMainForm.btnShowSecondForm(Sender: TObject);
var
   frm: TTheSecondForm;
begin
   frm := TTheSecondForm.Create(self);
   try
      frm.ShowModal;
   finally
      frm.Free;
   end;
end;
