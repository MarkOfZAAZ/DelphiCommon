# Delphi Dabbling
The code in this repository are a collection of bits n bobs that I am fed up of re-creating in every application!

## uHelperListView
This is essentially the Component TListViewZaaz (modified TListView) as Class Helpers, hence no requirement to install a component! (Makes moving the code to a different IDE simpler)

## Launch a second form
One of the first things I did using RAD Studio, was launch a second TForm object (This was back way before Android / IOS existed)

Something to remember: Do you need to automatically create the form at application start?

If not, then in your project, click on the menu Project---> Options---> Forms and remove the appropriate forms from the Auto-create forms list box

### FMX Modern Style Delphi code (For Android / IOS to avoid it returning straight away!)
This approach uses the modern Delphi in code variable (var) declarations, i..e at create time, not in the section between the procedure/function and the first begin.

The boat is still out for me! 

```delphi
procedure TMainForm.btnShowSecondForm(Sender: TObject);
begin
   var := TTheSecondForm.Create(nil);
   frm.ShowModal (
      procedure(ModalResult: TModalResult)
      begin
         // Put something here to do AFTER form has closed and come back e.g.
         // RefreshFirstPage;
      end
   );
end;
```

### FMX Traditional Delphi code (For Android / IOS to avoid it returning straight away!)
```delphi
procedure TMainForm.btnShowSecondForm(Sender: TObject);
var
   frm: TTheSecondForm;
begin
   frm := TTheSecondForm.Create(nil);
   frm.ShowModal (
      procedure(ModalResult: TModalResult)
      begin
         // Put something here to do AFTER form has closed and come back e.g.
         // RefreshFirstPage;
      end
   );
end;
```

### VCL
```delphi
procedure TMainForm.btnShowSecondForm(Sender: TObject);
var
   frm: TTheSecondForm;
begin
   frm := TTheSecondForm.Create(self);
   try
      frm.ShowModal;
   finally
      frm.Free; // safe in VCL apps, not so much in FMX
   end;
end;
```
